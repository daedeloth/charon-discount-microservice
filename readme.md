Charon-powered Discount Calculating Microservice

Why is this overengineered? Because I wanted to use Charon.

------------
```
composer install
bower install
```
 
...should do the trick.

Why bower? Yea, should switch to npm. But this is a test, not a production project.

(Yes I also user bower for production projects.)

Usage
-----
Go straight to /docs.

Authentication
--------------
None. Free for all. No authentication, no throttling.
